# Errata 5775

[eid5775]9https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5775)

It is not clear how to derive `CMK[j]`

This is related to [Errata 5770](5770.html), and the fix is similar.

Since we have:

```
        CMK[j] = last 20 octets of IMCK[j]
```

The definition of `CMK[0]` is clear.  It just needs to be written down.

```
        CMK[0] = last 20 octets of IMCK[0]
```

This matches the implementations.
