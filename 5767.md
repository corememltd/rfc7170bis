# Errata 5767

[eid5767](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5767)

The text uses `inner EAP method` when it should really use `inner EAP
authentication method`.

On closer examination, the text also used `inner EAP method` when it
really meant `any inner authentication method` This ambiguity made the
text unclear, with some places using `EAP or password`, and other
places using just `EAP`.

## Fix

Define a new term:

**Inner method**

> An authentication method which is sent as application data inside
> of a TLS exchange which is carried over TEAP.  The inner method
> can be an EAP authentication method, a username / password
> authentication, or a vendor-specific authentication method.

This definition is then used consistently in the document.
