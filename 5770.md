# Errata 5770

[eid5770](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5770)

Short summary:

    Section 5.4 claims that IMCK (and as such, also) S-IMCK[j] is derived
    by combining the MSKs from inner EAP methods while Section 5.2 talks
    about two different derivations: one based on MSK and the other one
    based on EMSK.

i.e. `IMCK[j]` is derived from _either_ EMSK or MSK.  The original text had

    IMSK = ... TLS-PRF(EMSK, ..)

Which had a few problems:

* the definition here used `IMSK`, and the later uses were `IMSK[j]`, which is inconsistent.

* the secret is defined as `EMSK`, while the later text went "no, really, it's sometimes `MSK`".

* there was no discussion of what to do with `S-IMCK` derived from different sources.

## Fix

Define `IMCK[j]` as:

        IMSK[j] = First 32 octets of TLS-PRF(secret, "TEAPbindkey@ietf.org",
           0x00 \| 0x00 \| 0x40)

where `secret` is `EMSK[j]` or `MSK[j]`.

And then means note that we need to derive _two_ sequences of `S-IMCK[j]`:

    S-IMCK_MSK[j]

and

    S-IMCK_EMSK[j]

As part of this cleanup, clarify some other text around
`session_key_seed` and `CMK[j]` for consistency.
